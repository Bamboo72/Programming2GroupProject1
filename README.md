# Programming 2 Group Project: The Isle of Laeso
This is our group project for Programming 2. We wanted to make a Catan style board game where you are stranded on an island with rivals and you are racing to survive and develop.

When the game starts out every player is on their own part of the Isle of Laeso. In turn they each roll the die, move, and collect resources. Once enough resources are gathered players can build structures such as storehouses, forts, or even ports. The main goal of the game is to collect enough resources to build a port and survive the sea voyage off the island, but there are a few different ways to win. It's a race against the other players to survive the Isle of Laeso!

We decided on a viking theme to make the game interesting and distinct. From our initial research into viking mythology we learned about an island mentioned in Norse tales that is suspected to be the modern Danish island of [Læsø](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A6s%C3%B8). This was our inspiration for the name of our game.

All graphics were created in Adobe Illustrator by Jacob Schwartz, and are displayed using Swing. We decided on Swing to display our graphics becuase we had been focused on Java this school year, and decided to use what we were most used to. The programming was divided by class between the group members so that everyone had a role to play in the project development.


## Roles:
- Andrew Blodgett: Dice, Board, and Resource Programming
- Maximilian Sutton: Settings, Character Creation, and Game Turn Logic Programming
- Jacob Schwartz: Graphics, Project Management, and GUI Programming 
- Brandon Winters: Natural Events and Event Generation

## Gameplay Instructions:

After selecting the number of players and creating characters for each player, the game begins!  

In order, each player will take their turn:  
1. Roll the die using the die button.  
2. Move and collect resources by clicking on desired locations and resources. (Careful! There's no takebacks!)  
3. Choose to either build, attack, or end your turn by clicking the buttons at the bottom of the screen. Note that building or attacking will end your turn.  

There are multiple ways to win. You could escape the island, collect enough magic to ascend, or be the last player alive on the island. Keep each win condition in mind as you play!
