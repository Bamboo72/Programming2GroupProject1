# Programming 2 Group Project: The Isle of Laeso
This is our group project for Programming 2. We want to make a Catan style board game where you are stranded on an island with rivals and you are racing to survive and develop. You will be able to collect, trade, and fight for resources and use those resources to develop your base.

## Roles:
- Andrew Blodgett: Dice, Board, and Resource Programming
- Maximilian Sutton: Settings, Character Creation, and Game Turn Logic Programming
- Jacob Schwartz: Graphics, Project Management, and GUI Programming
